\label{sec:weaknesses}

I have yet to develop a better approach to reading.
 Not because of difficulty in understanding but because having a better
 method might make it faster for me to read through a larger body of articles
 (important now that I am just starting my PhD).
 My general tendency is to read quite deeply into an individual paper or
 book, whilst it could be better to have a quicker way of getting an overview
 even at the expense of missing out on details; those one can always come
 back to if one finds it to be relevant.

Furthermore, even though I try to follow a structured process when writing,
 I often get blocks or spend more time than what I judge is necessary on
 some parts, even though I apply the strategy of having a general skeleton
 that I gradually expand (which I think enables not only structuring and
 paragraphing, but also makes it easier to aim what to write exactly in
 each session spent on a specific text).
 Something that maybe I will get past with practice but I would like to
 improve my approach to writing to ease the process.
