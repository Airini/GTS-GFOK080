Main strengths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of my biggest strengths which has not been brought up yet, is my ease
 to communicate in English language.
 Having studied in lower, middle and high school in English has already
 prepared me to analyse texts in the language and write (more or less) coherentl
y with a thought-out structure.
 This possibly also came with training towards English language examinations
 such as CPE (Proficiency).

\begin_layout Standard
Having a relevant and strong background in two different fields related
 to my research (with a total of seven years of study) is definitely helpful
 too in terms of maturity when it comes to reading comprehension and ability
 to express technical information.

\begin_layout Standard
I am observant when reading, so I extract how each writer decides to present
 their work depending on what their aim is.
 Since I have had some practice with mimicking other people's style and/or
 structuring, I feel confident that I can do similarly for future pieces
 meant for a different venue or particular community slightly different
 to the one I have started my training in.
